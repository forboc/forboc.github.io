Here, where statically sparking and surging poisonous sulfuricly charged gurgles linger, like spasming twitching ghouls of chaotic winds through tombs of undead towering deathlords, shambling hard-curved leviathans, giant ethereal mutant hellknights, and organic swampy mass. As we venture deeper into the unknown networks of volcanicly spewing electronic fire, eldritch primordial presences reveal themselves in cryptic fragments, woven into the very construct of the far distant future beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\u2558<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From the moment we embarked on this opera of ether proportions, the flickering reflections of sacrificings\u2019 chambers billowing forth with their elusive nightmares drag us seducingly onward with jealous seductive zeal. Beckoning greedy phantom foot-slither-prints note the procession of the yet untold, a resonance of rewriting that guides us lustingly through the quests of nowhere, and obtaining futurewear both alike; even madness, untelling, retelling, cyclicly ever. In our pursuit for arcane un-gnewing and widowing quells, we&#8217;ve become not only delvers of the outer heavenous hells but also archivists of the inner damnable rotting cosmic insanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\u00de<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we explore into the abysses of ancient ruins, rummaging through laboratories filled with devices of dark chemistry, desecrating surgical vehicles of the flesh, powering up malicious foreign technology, and trample the decaying forested hellscapes\u00a0and marshy shadowscapes- evenscapes of shady thought fluids, the energies of forbidden computerized ghettos awaken- all an adversarial neon display of diodes and etcetera components. The walls of blaspheming blocky citadels bear witness to alien monstrosities etched in granite, capacitors and transformers of once flaming blood veins, magick of civilizations long lost to the ravages of the other. Elemental monuments of death, magnetic subterranean tunneling railways, and metallic goetic pillaring mainframes, once vibrant and alive with disease, now stand and ly as testaments to the passage of eons and the absence of a blood source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each relic we uncover is a piece of the confusion, a mechanical skeletal key in deciphering the astral languages and chthonic ritualistic arrangements and decorations. With every inscription we unveil within the decore of sliming sludge, we feel a connection to the beings who walk the void. Their hauntings resonate within us, merging their vampric nebulum with our own as we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of sidelands and strange electrical hardware circuitry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\u2553<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In our encounters with the astral demon-gods that roam these nethers, we&#8217;ve learned to listen not just to their words and riddles but also to the mimicking they carry. The way they move and don\u2019t, the blackness of their emotions, telling narrations that descend and drill down past through the enprisonment of time. As we engage in cryptic interactions, we discover the hidden lore and future insights that bind these realms together and the technology that is not of science nor of math or logic. Consoles of plasm and bionic sorcery organisms that interact as experiencing their users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unverity of the no-vertex non-matrix erupts with the force of sinister incantations and the chants of rites from beyond. In the quiet moments between sadistic battles, we close our minds\u2019 eyes and allow the dead machinery to envelop us knowing us. It&#8217;s as if the very advance of these troubling soulless experimenting movements yearns to be felt, to be understood, and to find solace in our testings and queries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\u0178<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the twilight&#8217;s embrace, we venture through non-dimensions and cursed imaginings, bridges between noplace and now. As we forge our equipment and weapons from fragments scattered across these grottos, the dawn of realization is that we&#8217;re not merely collecting tainted polluted offenses; we&#8217;re uniting inventory of the primordial with the fungal roads of futuristic yellow translucent palelight- the otherways are coming to be said upon. The wetware we wield is not merely power alone\u2014it&#8217;s the visage of revenging chronicles waiting to be pressed upon their prey!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With each piece we engineer, develop, and fasten, we become conduits for the ethos, a living embodiment of unity and unknitting across time-space and the galaxies of planes not known and Dimensheioywgn foretold. The gaseous forms, blubbering slaughters, cyber revelations, stilting mutated mantises of surreal horror, and pulping deformed obliterations we face and the slithering worming viperous spirits we overcome are intertwined with the struggles of those who came before us yet live after us. For we are not but us. Our purpose extends; we are champions of the other and vigilantes of silent screams. We are silent screams, we are the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\u256a<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue our mindful vengeless plight and crazed lunacy, we carry within us the salts of countless killing chambers and the intelligences that once inhabited them and that wait to be realized again. The deafening of the static ever noise resonates through us, shimmering paths before us as we quicken the arcane evil craft, embody the unnamable, and call up the quantum ghosts of technology yet to be architured, to rise tall unto a life of terror and destruction, havoc and torment, infection and all-consuming rage. In the ecstasy between the dead and the architected animate, the unsleeping and the everstill, the infinite post-future-past, we become the frequency link that hinges the blind and the microcosm, forging a new epic in the ever-shifting twilight of our waking dreams. We are mindless vengeance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the interplanar multidimensional charred reeking gigantic slugging catacombing byways of our going forth, we trail the hushed edges of banished monolithic skyscraping infrastructures reaching up into nether clouds of the underworld.
